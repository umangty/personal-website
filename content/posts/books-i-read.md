Reading and writing is one of the most important habits one can acquire. It helps one analyse the history, civics and geography of the topic in hand. The kind of satisfaction, or for the lack of better word, high, one can get from book reading is immense. I never got interested in reading books till I was 18-19 years old. I used to see my father putting a lot of effort in creating reading materials for his students. Same case my mother too. She used to, and still does, make all the questions papers for exams in hand-written pages and not take printouts ever. At least I have never see her do that.
